# Commands

Let's go through the commands by examples. The source code for the tools is located at `cmd/*`. The options for the tools can be viewed with `./binary_name -h`.

The example for pressure testing the system is at the end of this document.

## Node

### Run Nodes

1. Generate the credentials for the trading accounts

   ```bash
   $ ./gen_credentials -N 10000
   ```

   The above command generates 10000 public and secret keys pairs, stored at `./credentials` by default.

1. Generate the genesis file and the initial consensus protocol group files

   - The genesis file contains the genesis block and the genesis state.
   - The initial consensus protocol group files contain the credentials for all the participating nodes and
     the group assignments. The protocol supports open participation (specified but not yet implemented),
     any node can join the mining groups providing proof of frozen fund. Please see the
     [White Paper](https://github.com/helinwang/dex/wiki/White-Paper) for details.

   The command below configures three nodes and three groups with the group threshold set to two (group size needs to be around 400 for the network to be safe with a very high probability. We are using three for demonstration purpose).
   The BNB native token and the tokens specified in `tokens.txt` are distributed evenly
   to all the trading accounts insider the `./credentials` folder.

   ```bash
   $ cat > tokens.txt
   BTC,90000000000,8
   ETH,90000000000,8
   XRP,90000000000,8
   EOS,90000000000,8
   ICX,90000000000,8
   TRX,90000000000,8
   XLM,90000000000,8
   BCC,90000000000,8
   LTC,90000000000,8
   $ ./gen_genesis -N 3 -t 2 -g 3 -tokens tokens.txt -distribute-to ./credentials -dir ./genesis
   ```

   Each row is `SYMBOL,SUPPLY,DECIMALS`. BNB is generated as the native token by default, so no need to specify here.

1. If testing on different machines, please make sure to use the same generated files.

1. Start nodes.
   The total node count is three, and the group threshold is two,
   so running two nodes is sufficient for the demonstration purpose.
   1. Start node 0 on port 9000, wallet RPC service is on port 12000
      `$ ./node -c genesis/nodes/node-0 -genesis genesis/genesis.gob -port 9000 -rpc-addr ":12000"`
   1. Start node 1 on port 9001, wallet RPC service is on port 12001, use `:9000` as the seed node
      `$ ./node -c genesis/nodes/node-1 -genesis genesis/genesis.gob -port 9001 -rpc-addr ":12001" -seed ":9000"`
      Now you will see the random beacon running, and empty blocks being produced.

## Wallet

The `wallet` binary is a CLI. It talks with the node through the node's wallet RPC service.

```

You can see the orders were matched according to time priority, execution reports are generated for each execution,
and the pending order is shown as well. Also, a flat 0.0001 BNB fee is charged per transaction.
I did not have enough time to implement the percentage-based trading fee, or adjustable fee according to the network condition.
But it would not be too hard to implement.

Cancel Order:

```
$ ./wallet -c ./credentials/node-0 cancel 2_1_0
```

Please note that cancelling an order will not generate an execution report.

### Issue Token

Issue HELIN_COIN, total supply 999999, decimals 8:

```
$ ./wallet -c ./credentials/node-0 issue_token HELIN_COIN 999999 8
```

### Send Token

Due to time constraint, I only implemented send to public key, send to address is easy to add.

1. Get the public key of the account 1
   ```
   $ ./credential_info -c credentials/node-1
   credential info (bytes encoded using base64):
   SK: hDTgUQxmwGCaG/abozy/iIMHiT1S3OtlxFAa5TRmmRU=
   PK: BAv9dVwsREUF5dn1iIiGAioDB7bvE/fiXopXiFkj58eO7VlXzF9srrnNy1d4c7Kcqm8Niv4yeBQKRlwQLnUFDBQ=
   Addr: c09676fdec88c1e960e6398f1c281defdd1cb4fa
   ```
1. Send to account 1's public key:

   ```
   $ ./wallet -c ./credentials/node-0 send BAv9dVwsREUF5dn1iIiGAioDB7bvE/fiXopXiFkj58eO7VlXzF9srrnNy1d4c7Kcqm8Niv4yeBQKRlwQLnUFDBQ= HELIN_COIN 20
   ```

   Verify account 1 received it:

   ```
   $ ./wallet -c ./credentials/node-1 account
   Addr:
   c09676fdec88c1e960e6398f1c281defdd1cb4fa

   Balances:

    |LTC        |9000000.00000000 |0.00000000 |       |
    |HELIN_COIN |20.00000000      |0.00000000 |       |

   Pending Orders:
    |ID |Market |Side |Price |Amount |Executed |Expiry Block Height |

   Execution Reports:
    |Block |ID |Market |Side |Trade Price |Amount |
   ```

### Freeze Token

Freeze 10000 BNB at round (round is same as block height) 500.
Please make sure the expiration round is bigger than the current round.
You can check the current round using `./wallet status`.

```
$ ./wallet -c ./credentials/node-0 freeze BNB 10000 500

$ ./wallet -c ./credentials/node-0 account
Addr:
9278552d23bb4cad6e9b1210853f6b9af107f720

Balances:
 |Symbol |Available        |Pending    |Frozen             |
 |BNB    |9999.99990000    |0.00000000 |10000.00000000@500 |
 |BTC    |9000000.00000000 |0.00000000 |                   |
 |ETH    |9000000.00000000 |0.00000000 |                   |
 |XRP    |9000000.00000000 |0.00000000 |                   |
 |EOS    |9000000.00000000 |0.00000000 |                   |
 |ICX    |9000000.00000000 |0.00000000 |                   |
 |TRX    |9000000.00000000 |0.00000000 |                   |
 |XLM    |9000000.00000000 |0.00000000 |                   |
 |BCC    |9000000.00000000 |0.00000000 |                   |
 |LTC    |9000000.00000000 |0.00000000 |                   |

Pending Orders:
 |ID |Market |Side |Price |Amount |Executed |Expiry Block Height |

Execution Reports:
 |Block |ID |Market |Side |Trade Price |Amount |
```

Please note that after implementing the freeze function, I realized the freeze function in BNB's Ether contract is freeze until unfrozen, rather than freeze until block height.
I did not have a chance to match this behavior, but it would be easy to implement.

### Burn Token

Burn 1000 BTC:

```
$ ./wallet -c ./credentials/node-0 burn BTC 1000
```

The total supply of BTC is reduced as well:

```
$ ./wallet token
 | Symbol|         Total Supply| Decimals|
 |    BNB|   200000000.00000000|        8|
 |    BTC| 89999999000.00000000|        8|
 |    ETH| 90000000000.00000000|        8|
 |    XRP| 90000000000.00000000|        8|
 |    EOS| 90000000000.00000000|        8|
 |    ICX| 90000000000.00000000|        8|
 |    TRX| 90000000000.00000000|        8|
 |    XLM| 90000000000.00000000|        8|
 |    BCC| 90000000000.00000000|        8|
 |    LTC| 90000000000.00000000|        8|
```

### Draw Chain's Blocks

```
$ ./wallet graphviz
digraph chain {
rankdir=LR;
size="12,8"
node [shape = rect, style=filled, color = chartreuse2]; block_c669 block_2616 block_6595 num_blocks_omitted_to_save_space_148 block_aebe block_a4e1 block_bca4
node [shape = rect, style=filled, color = aquamarine]; block_2d04 block_54e3
block_c669 -> block_2616 -> block_6595 -> num_blocks_omitted_to_save_space_148 -> block_aebe -> block_a4e1 -> block_bca4
block_bca4 -> block_2d04
block_2d04 -> block_54e3

}
```

It prints the blockchain representation in the graphviz format.
You can paste it to http://www.webgraphviz.com/ to see the visualization.
Some blocks in the middle will be omitted (indicated by "num_blocks_omitted_to_save_space_148").
The green block is the finalized block. The blue block is the non-finalized block.

## Pressure Testing

`gen_order_replay` is the tool to generate the order replay file, and `order_replayer` replays it.

1. Generate the replay file
   ```
   $ ./gen_order_replay -count 100000 > replay.txt
   ```
1. Replay the orders
   ```
   $ ./order_replayer -c credentials -path replay.txt
   ```
1. Check the system status
   ```
